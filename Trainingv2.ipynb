He makes you laugh, buys you little gifts, pleases you well and…he accepts your kink. “Hi Daddy. What are we going to do today?” You ask him as you bat your eyelashes. It’s been since you were 18 that you decided you wanted the attention of older men. The guys your age just couldn’t compete. They left you feeling unsatisfied with their fibs of knowing how to please a woman. Most of them couldn’t even locate the clitoris, let alone give a woman an orgasm. “You know what we’re going to do today, princess.” His hands wrap themselves around your waist as he places wet kisses all over your neck.
